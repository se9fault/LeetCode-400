/*
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it
reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:    Input: 121    Output: true

Example 2:    Input: -121   Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes
121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:    Input: 10     Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        // if x < 0, or ends with 0 (but is not 0), then it's not a palindrome
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {
            return false;
        }

        while (x > revertedNumber) {
            revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        // When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit
        // by revertedNumber/10, For example when the input is 12321, at the end
        // of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123, since the
        // middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to
        // itself), we can simply get rid of it.
        return x == revertedNumber || x == revertedNumber/10;

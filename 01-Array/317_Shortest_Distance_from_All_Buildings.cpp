/*
You want to build a house on an  empty  land which reaches all buildings in the
shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are
given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.

For example, given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at
(0,2):
1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel
distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.

Note:
There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house
according to the above rules, return -1.

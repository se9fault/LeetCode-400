/*
There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following
requirements:
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:
Input: [1,0,2]    Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2
candies respectively.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,2]    Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1
candies respectively. The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the
above two conditions.
